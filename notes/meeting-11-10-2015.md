# MQP B-term week 3

# AGENDA - will edit once we get into meeting


### What we did:

* Worked a little on the paper
* Created two NNs (one is a dummy) with the Haxby dataset
    * Visualization for the dummy is done
* Got *some* code to work on the ACE cluster
    - python2 only, and we're fine with that - just convert the Python3 code over. It shouldn't be much work with 3to2 and the fact we still need to convert from .ipynb
* Prof. Kong got the dataset, but we haven't transfered it over to us



### What we will do:
