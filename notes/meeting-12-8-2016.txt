* We did everything from last week! (everyone is shocked)
* The old convolutional network was poorly set up
* max patch now works!!!!!
	- each row is a patch, each column is a z value per patch
	- need to either make the patch size bigger or something else
	- run on full dataset (88)
	- could visualize on the first layer and do max patch on the second layer
	- try capturing simpler patterns?
	- still trained for only 5 epochs
	- could try capturing simpler on the earlier layers, then capture more complex visualizations on later layers
* Ezra would like to auto-calculate patch size
	- kong says we can calculate automatically
	- currently our code does not
	- depends on how we can use keras
	- kong's way: go by nodes and trace back; every node in the traceback is included
	- ezra's way: filter through each layer using keras, traceback to the original image; faking back propagation
	- minor changes to saliency map can also give us max patch
* We agreed to work over break
* TODO for next week:
	- auto-calculate
	- fix the broken deep visualization and produce it
	- try to implement updating training weights?
	- NO MEETING NEXT WEEK
