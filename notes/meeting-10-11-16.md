What we did:
* Deconvolutional visualization
* GoogLeNet V1 with Max Patch visualization
* Saliency maps visualization, not sure how accurate
* barely started on a deep dreams visualization

This project is about visualization and convolutional networks.
We're hoping that it will work for medical imaging.

If we're interested in visualizing convolutional neural networks, we could create a new visualization that happens to work on both images and neural networks.
Or, we could work on visualizations for neural networks.
Or, we could use a complex CNN (our own, or GoogLeNet...) on neural imaging data


What we want to do:
* Research what we can/want-to do with the MQP that would be useful
* Deep dreams type visualization
* Possibly start transferring over medical images (UMass people)
  * Professor Kong will ask for a few example datasets
* Saliency maps (reread paper), combine with deconvolutional layer
* Get larger dataset & try different visualizations on GoogleNet
