## Meeting Tuesday 1 24

- Did MaxPatch viz autosizing and viewing on 2D data. Autosizing should work regardless
- Got saliency maps working in two ways
  - Produces 4D 'video' saliency maps
    - Could create video
  - Takes forever to train
  - Can work via using saliency maps all the way back to the beginning, or using saliency maps for one layer and deconvolutions for the rest
  
### Todo
- Think about the final project's poster
- Work on the network model (using autoencoder)
  - Figure out if autoencoder is more useful than existing brain regions/partitionings? (PCA brain? (probably not))
- Analysis of the brain data via visualizations
