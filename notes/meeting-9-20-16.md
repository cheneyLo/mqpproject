# MQP meeting Tuesday September 20th

## What we did:
We got on the same page for Neural networks.
Did a few more of the tutorials (and made a keras digit classifier network)
Ryan started work on a deconvolutional neural network (from scratch using Theano).

We've got a github repository:
https://github.com/mqpteam2016/mqpproject

We've divvied up a background chapter we'll work on - fMRIs, machine learning, visualization subsections.

## What we talked about

#### Some demos
1. http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/cifar10.html
2. http://playground.tensorflow.org/

#### Class on CNNs - http://cs231n.stanford.edu
All about images, but has more technical details,
pros and cons if different activation functions, etc...
  For instance ReLU is better for fixing the vanishing gradient problem
    It's closer to depth first search than breadth first search

#### Deconvolutional neural networks
We went over a few things about deconvolutional neural networks.
The bulk of the information is originally from this paper:
http://www.matthewzeiler.com/pubs/cvpr2010/cvpr2010.pdf
Or this paper:
http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Noh_Learning_Deconvolution_Network_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf

## What we will do this week:
[ ] Look through the deconvolutional paper (higher priority)
[ ] Read the Theano code John sent us (higher priority)
[ ] Vis simple
[ ] Demo
[ ] Look through online courses
[ ] Finish Keras/Theano tutorials (Miya & Ezra)
[ ] Write some of the background paper
