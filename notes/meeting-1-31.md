This is probably the depression dataset...

Predicting the `Glu` `Glx` would be good, but predicting the `DX` column (bipolar or not) is what we really care about.

Regression is (probably) a reasonable choice isn't an unreasonable loss function, but cross_entropy might be fine too.

We can try a couple of choices for the NN (3-5 options), and then evaluate them.

We probably want maxpatch to show location of the patch and/or the entire patch in cross sections.
