### What we did

* Loading UMass data - much of the UMASS fmri data doesn't match up with the summary xlsx, but we've married up the 66 fmris that do.
* We've also been working on the NN that figures out regions of the brain


### What we will do

We aren't going to meet next week because of Thanksgiving.

* Meet more often - we didn't meet enough last week (we had several conflicts), so we'll meet more over the weekend
* Maybe write a job that converts the fmri `nii.gz` files and turns them into time series (either with regions, or the raw data)

* Get the simple NN running on the new dataset
* Pooling network (the temporal fMRI)
* Region creating network
    * When we train any of these, we should keep checkpoints every 100-10000 epochs so that if we quit the training before it finishes, we don't lose much data.
