## Meeting 2-21

65% loss for region based network. (using dictionary regions on our dataset)
We get a very similar results to the John (the grad student).
The brain region chart looks good.

The video for the CNN network brain network is currently loading. (We could do one for the autoencoder, but it gives very poor quality results)


We will have to continue into next term - Ezra will go to the registrar/academic advising to figure out our options.


##### Plan for this term:
- Commit all visualizations to git repo
- Have solid outline for paper + some text
