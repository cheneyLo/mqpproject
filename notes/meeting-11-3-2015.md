# MQP B-term week 2


* The confidential dataset probably won't be available until next week

### What we did:

* Made plan
    * Decided we need to work on the paper more often (every other working meeting)
* Got access to ACE cluster
* Worked with Nilearn
    * Animation, visualization
    * Segmentation of brain data
    * Haxby dataset



### What we will do:

* Write more of the paper
* Create a Deep NN + visualization for Haxby dataset, or Kong's dataset, if available
    * Probably a naive Deep NN - Convolutional NNs on raw brain data
    * Probably Max Patch
* Get some code to work on the ACE cluster (install nilearn - local version `pip install --user nilearn` )
    * We'll do a batch job (there are already instructions)
* Prof. Kong will reach out ot the UMass people to get the dataset
